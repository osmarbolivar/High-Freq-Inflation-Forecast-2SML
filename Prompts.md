I’m currently working on research entitled “High-frequency Inflation Forecasting: A Two-Step Machine Learning Methodology”. The attached file “LAJCB_High_Freq_Inflation_Forecast.pdf” describes the methodology with greater detail given that the research objective is to propose and test a methodology enabling high-frequency (weekly/daily) inflation forecasting by leveraging mixed-frequency data and machine learning. It is tested for the case of Bolivia as an example of a country with data-scarce environment where weekly or daily inflation rates are not published (or generated) by official institutions. 
Additionally, I attached a former version of my research (Weekly_Inflation_Forecast.pdf) where the scope was limited to weekly inflation forecasting. You can use this document to update your memory and suggest greater improvements to my extended research “High-frequency Inflation Forecasting: A Two-Step Machine Learning Methodology”.
I need you to behave as an economist specialized in machine learning and econometrics, with a deep understanding of forecasting and nowcasting. Based upon this, you must help and guide me to develop my research and write my paper with high technical and editorial rigor. Are you ready?

•  Refining the methodology or making it more robust?

•  Enhancing the literature review with more recent or relevant sources? 

•  Improving the editorial quality and structure of the paper? 

•  Expanding on the policy implications of your findings? 

•  Developing better visualizations or results interpretation? 

•  Ensuring proper statistical validation and robustness checks?

## What do you think about my methodology described in “LAJCB_High_Freq_Inflation_Forecast.pdf”? is it clear, technically rigorous? How would you improve it?

- The framework is grounded in known concepts – for example, aggregating daily and weekly indicators to monthly frequency is reminiscent of mixed-frequency models like MIDAS, ensuring all predictors align with the monthly inflation target. How would you modify the methodology, so it explains that the two-step machine learning follows MIDAS rational, but it differentiates in the fact that seeks to build a mixed-frequency dataset enabling us to apply monthly-trained machine learning models to high-frequency data under the assumption of similar data generating processes across time frequencies?
