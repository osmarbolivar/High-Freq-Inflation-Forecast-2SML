I’m currently working on research entitled “High-frequency Inflation Forecasting: A Two-Step Machine Learning Methodology”. The attached file “LAJCB_High_Freq_Inflation_Forecast.pdf” describes the methodology with greater detail given that the research objective is to propose and test a methodology enabling high-frequency (weekly/daily) inflation forecasting by leveraging mixed-frequency data and machine learning. It is tested for the case of Bolivia as an example of a country with data-scarce environment where weekly or daily inflation rates are not published (or generated) by official institutions. 
Additionally, I attached a former version of my research (Weekly_Inflation_Forecast.pdf) where the scope was limited to weekly inflation forecasting. You can use this document to update your memory and suggest greater improvements to my extended research “High-frequency Inflation Forecasting: A Two-Step Machine Learning Methodology”.
I need you to behave as an economist specialized in machine learning and econometrics, with a deep understanding of forecasting and nowcasting. Based upon this, you must help and guide me to develop my research and write my paper with high technical and editorial rigor. Are you ready?

## What do you think about my methodology described in “LAJCB_High_Freq_Inflation_Forecast.pdf”? is it clear, technically rigorous? How would you improve it?

- The framework is grounded in known concepts – for example, aggregating daily and weekly indicators to monthly frequency is reminiscent of mixed-frequency models like MIDAS, ensuring all predictors align with the monthly inflation target. How would you modify the methodology, so it explains that the two-step machine learning follows MIDAS rational, but it differentiates in the fact that seeks to build a mixed-frequency dataset enabling us to apply monthly-trained machine learning models to high-frequency data under the assumption of similar data generating processes across time frequencies?

The connection between covariance stationarity and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test will be explicitly stated, highlighting how the assumption of stationarity justifies the expectation consistency of high-frequency data when aggregated into a monthly format. Additionally, a brief explanation of why the K–S test is suitable for validating distributional equivalence in this context will be included.

I will provide the refined text shortly.

## Covariance Stationarity and Expectation Consistency in High-Frequency Inflation Forecasting

**Covariance stationarity** (a form of weak stationarity) means a time series has constant mean and variance over time, and its covariance structure depends only on the time lag, not on the actual time ([02 Stationary time series](https://web.vu.lt/mif/a.buteikis/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Lecture_02.pdf#:~:text=All%20time%20series%20may%20be,%E2%88%922%20%E2%88%921%200%201%202)) ([stationarity - Can stationary time series contain regulary cycles and periods with different fluctuations - Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/491785/can-stationary-time-series-contain-regulary-cycles-and-periods-with-different-fl#:~:text=%24,stationarity.%20%24%5Cendgroup)). In the context of high-frequency inflation data (e.g. daily or weekly price changes), assuming covariance stationarity implies: 

- **Stable Mean:** The expected value of inflation is constant over time. This guarantees **expectation consistency** when aggregating high-frequency data to a monthly format. In other words, the average of the high-frequency inflation rates over any given month should equal the long-run monthly inflation rate (after adjusting for the number of periods). By linearity of expectation, if daily inflation has a constant mean μ, then the expected monthly inflation (as the sum or average of daily values) is proportional to μ, matching the true monthly inflation’s expectation. This **justifies using high-frequency data without introducing bias**, because the high-frequency process does not drift away from the monthly process in terms of average level. An inflation forecasting model built on stationary high-frequency data will therefore remain **unbiased** when its predictions are aggregated to monthly inflation – the model’s expectations align with the actual monthly outcomes on average.

- **Consistent Variance and Autocovariance:** Covariance stationarity also implies the variability and correlation structure of inflation is stable over time. This means patterns in high-frequency fluctuations repeat consistently, and aggregating them preserves the essential information. As a result, the model can be applied at the high-frequency level and aggregated up without systematically over- or under-predicting monthly inflation. The stationarity assumption ensures that the relationship between high-frequency variations and monthly outcomes remains consistent across the sample, supporting the validity of forecasting monthly inflation from high-frequency inputs.

By ensuring the high-frequency inflation series is covariance stationary, we **preserve distributional consistency** across time. Every month is drawn from the same statistical process as any other month (no regime shifts in mean or variance), so an aggregation of days or weeks yields a monthly figure that is *expectationally* equivalent to the observed monthly inflation. This underpins the **unbiased model application**: the forecasting model doesn’t need to compensate for changing means or variances when moving between frequencies.

## Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test for Distributional Equivalence

When we aggregate high-frequency inflation data into monthly data, we not only want the means to align, but we also want the **overall distribution** to be similar to that of actual monthly inflation. The **Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test** is particularly suitable for validating this **distributional equivalence**:

- **Nonparametric Distribution Comparison:** The K–S test is a general, nonparametric test that compares two samples to determine if they come from the same underlying distribution ([Kolmogorov–Smirnov test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test#:~:text=Note%20that%20the%20two,test%20is%20that%20it%20is)). It makes no assumption about what that distribution is (aside from being continuous under the null hypothesis), which is ideal in our context where we may not know the exact distribution of inflation rates. We can use a two-sample K–S test to compare the distribution of aggregated high-frequency inflation data against the distribution of official monthly inflation data. Under the null hypothesis of the K–S test, the two samples are drawn from the **same distribution**, so a failure to reject this null would support the claim that the high-frequency data (when aggregated) is statistically indistinguishable from actual monthly inflation in a distributional sense.

- **Sensitivity to All Differences in Distribution:** The two-sample K–S test is sensitive to differences in both the **location and the shape** of the empirical cumulative distribution functions of the two samples ([Kolmogorov–Smirnov test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test#:~:text=The%20two,functions%20of%20the%20two%20samples)). This means it will detect not only a shift in mean (location) but also differences in variance, skewness, or any other aspect of the distribution’s shape. In high-frequency forecasting, this is important because we want to ensure that the entire distribution of monthly inflation (including tails and volatility) is captured well by the aggregated high-frequency data. If the high-frequency data were mis-specified or introduced bias, the K–S test would likely pick up a difference in the empirical CDFs (for example, the aggregated data might show systematically lower highs or higher lows). By using the K–S test, we can confirm **distributional alignment**: that the probabilities of various inflation outcomes (whether low, typical, or extreme inflation rates) are equivalent between the high-frequency-aggregated data and the true monthly data.

- **Why K–S in this Context:** Other tests might focus on specific moments (like a t-test for means or an F-test for variances), but the K–S test checks the **entire distribution**. In high-frequency inflation forecasting, ensuring the entire distribution is correct is crucial for a robust model – not just getting the mean right, but also the dispersion and tail risks. The K–S test’s breadth makes it an appropriate tool to validate that covariance stationarity (which should imply stable distributional properties) holds in practice. If the high-frequency data aggregation is done correctly under stationarity, the K–S test will show no significant difference between the distribution of aggregated forecasts and actual monthly inflation, giving us confidence that the model’s frequency conversion introduces no bias or distortion.

In summary, **covariance stationarity** provides the theoretical foundation that high-frequency inflation data can be aggregated to monthly frequency without changing its fundamental properties – the mean remains the same (ensuring unbiased expectations) and the process behaves consistently over time. The **Kolmogorov–Smirnov test** then serves as a rigorous check on this theory by comparing the empirical distributions: it verifies that the high-frequency-based monthly estimates are statistically indistinguishable from the actual monthly inflation data, confirming distributional equivalence and thus validating the model’s application across different frequencies.
